# Turogarde

Turogarde is a continent in the world of Evronar. It is currently a floruishing nation due to the creation of the [[Factions/Factions/Turovian Alliance\|Turovian Alliance]], which functions as a trade union between the 3 great city states, [[Vornaud\|Vornaud]] , [[Ardenvale\|Ardenvale]] and [[Vvarden\|Vvarden]].

Those are not the only states of Turogarde, however. Also living on Turogarde is the beastman city of [[Gorthal\|Gorthal]], comprised primarily of 'monstrous' races such as Orcs, goblins and even giants. Not all 'monsters' wish to live up to their namesake, of course.

Additional peoples on the land of Turogarde include the citizens of [[Ayara\|Ayara]], who live near an arcane nexus and have built their civilisation around the raw and primal magic that come near it. Aswell as the [[Factions/Factions/Vordhir\|Vordhir]], who reside in the frozen north of [[Locations/Regions/Turogarde/Iss-Vordhir\|Iss-Vordhir]].

Just as you'd find human, dwarven, or elven bandits, you can also find small groups of goblins, orcs or other races who seek to shrug off the modernity of civilisation and instead make their living through the ransacking of ancient ruins or, more likely, an ambushing of a caravan containing foodstuffs and other goods. It is also not uncommon to find bandit groups comprising of several races. one such famous group of cutthroats, called The [[Factions/Factions/Azure Devils\|Azure Devils]], are known for being comprised of nearly every sentient race imaginable.
