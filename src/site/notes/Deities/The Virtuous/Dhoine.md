Depicted as a large being of bark and bone, similar to a Leshen. their being an almost literal representation of how Nature always takes over in due Time. a humanoid figure made of vines, bark and leaves, their head similar to the skull of a deer, and what appears to be rib bones protruding out from their chest in what seems to indicate the hands of a clock frozen in time.

To say that Dhoine is disrespected would be incorrect, however of The Virtuous, they are likely to be the least celebrated by the 3 large nation-states of Turogarde, along with Zerith. Worshippers of Dhoine are more likely to be denizens of Ayara who are more in tune with the Druidic magic of the world. There is always a healthy respect for Dhoine, however, as one would be a fool to disrespect the ceaseless march of Time.

The symbol of Dhoine is a symbol of a cane wrapped in tree branches.
