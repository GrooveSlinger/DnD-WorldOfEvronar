Depicted as a tall, athletic woman garbed in leather armor, save a metal pauldron on her left shoulder, a gauntlet on her right, and a helmet that obscures her face, with long red hair flowing out the back. From under her leather armor, long cloths flow, and a Long sword held in her left hand.

What ends up differing in depictions of Elysia is what she's doing. in some artworks she may be seen singing, in statues she may be wielding a brush, and other works depict her as a whirling dervish, her dance being both beautiful and deadly.

The symbol of Elysia is the crossing of a Sword and a Painter's brush (think of the hammer and sickle)
