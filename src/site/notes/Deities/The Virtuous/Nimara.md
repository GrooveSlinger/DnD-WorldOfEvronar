Nimara is usually depicted as a larger woman, both in size and strength, wearing an assorted collection of plate armor, and despite looking like a warrior, there is no weapon with her. There is, however, a large Towering Shield at her side, and in some depictions, is seen nursing a baby.

Nimara is prayed to regularly for safety and peace over households, friends, family, and in some cases over entire nations. Wedding ceremonies are typically performed in a church of Nimara unless both sides of the family are strongly aligned with a particular god.

During the [[History/War of Fracture\|War of Fracture]], Nimara was instrumental in constructing The Divine Gate, the barrier through which The Vile's ability to impose upon the World of Evronar was severely diminished.

The symbol of Nimara is of a rectangular Tower Shield, and emblazoned across it is two chain links linked together.
