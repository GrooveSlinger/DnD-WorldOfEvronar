Zerith holds a weird place in the heart of the masses. responsible for the ferrying of souls to be returned to the aether, and responsible for the growing of crops, there is a somber respect to Zerith, for they come to any harvest.

Depicted as a simple humanoid figure in clothes, albeit with a hood and wielding a scythe. and instead of a face, a human skull floats in place with no connection to any seeming spine.

The symbol for Zerith is a skull, but the side of the skull is cracked open with wheat and life coming out of it.
