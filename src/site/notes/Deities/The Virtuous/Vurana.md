Commonly prayed to in critical moments but rarely revered to, Vurana, or Lady Luck, is depicted as a shadowy elusive figure. face unseen, she wears a hood and a long cloak that obscures most of her body, and underneath is the patchwork of leather armor.

Loved by Thieves, Gamblers, and Adventurers, Vurana is not known for having a big following, but to an extent, a loyal fanbase. For if you need help, it's always good to have The God of Chance on your side.

The symbol of Vurana is a Hood with a nondescript face, a glint where an eye would be and a sly smile.
