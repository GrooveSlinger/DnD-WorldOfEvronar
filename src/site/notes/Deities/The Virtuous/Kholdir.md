Looking at a statue of Kholdir, you'd almost think it unfinished, as Kholdir is depicted as a large stonelike humanoid figure, yet devoid of any distinct features. however, what immediately draws you to know that this is no unfinished project is the crescent moon symbol carved upon what would be his forehead, and the intricately detailed blacksmith's hammer he wields in his right hand.

Kholdir (Coal-deer) is the God of Dreams and The Crafts, and ostensibly rules over the domain of night as his brother, Aurendil, rules over the domain of day. He is largely revered by the Dwarves and other Denizens of Vvarden, who believe that the dreams of ideas they receive in their sleep to be blessings by Kholdir himself.

Devotee's of Kholdir are hard to find, as many believe that to devote oneself to a craft to be how to serve Kholdir, but a Cleric of Kholdir may wear the symbol of a Blacksmiths Hammer resting between the points of a crescent moon.
