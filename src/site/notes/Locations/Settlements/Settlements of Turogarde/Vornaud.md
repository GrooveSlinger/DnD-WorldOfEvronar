#### Description
Easily the largest City in Turogarde, Vornaud is a sprawling city filled with trade, industry, and depending where you are, crime. Situated on the north-western coast of the Elysar plains gives it plenty of space outside of the city walls to farm various produce for export, and being situated between Vvarden and Ardenvale makes it a great market for magical items and technological advances. Considered the patron city of Virellus, it certainly lives up to the god as one cannot think of any other place in the world where more coin exchanges hands.

There exists 5 districts within the City it can be divided by: The Docks, The Commons, Trader's Square, The Gold Quarter, and the Tower District.

The Tower district houses most of the nobility and wealthy of Vornaud, and a lot of business can be found within Trader's Square and The Gold Quarter.

#### Leadership
Since the War of Turogarde, Vornaud, and to some extent, it's 'vassal' towns, are ruled by election of 5 seats to represent the people. 5 seats to prevent any tie votes for matter of policy. 

The current elected officials, usually referred to with the title 'Count', are:
* Count Bree Greenleaf - Halfling Woman hidden

#### Shops

###### Maklors Magical -mporium
Located across the road from Normans office in the north eastern part of town, Maklor's Magical -mporium is a rather visible building between the offices and living spaces of this town, with a purple wooden exterior. it looks like the 'E' in Emporium has fallen off the sign, though it looks like it also might never have been there to begin with.

Interior is fairly dimly lit with the smell of incense burning throughout. there are a few display shelves and then a counter at the back of the room where Maklor usually resides.

Maklor is a tall male elf with long black hair and sharp features. talks like a nasally Professor Snape. despite this, he's actually quite friendly besides that and loves to gossip.

#### Vornaud specific Story Hooks
* If they ever visit the shop near Norman's work (Maklor's Magical -mporium) or norman's office itself, it looks like a town guard investigation is occurring. a raid of some kind occurred, and rumors are circulating that it was due to the [[Factions/Factions/Coincounter Knights\|Coincounter Knights]].
