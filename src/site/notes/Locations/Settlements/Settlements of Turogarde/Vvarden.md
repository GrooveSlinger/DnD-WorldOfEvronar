#### Description
Built into a large mountain and spiralling downwards into a large underground city, Vvarden is the technological centre of Turogarde, where creations spring forth in ways the rest of the world has never seen. as such, technology such as trains and engines can only be found here, as an ingenious dwarf recently invented the world's first steam engine.

#### Leadership
Vvarden continues to operate under a monarchy, however, the reins of leadership do not persist within a single family line. upon the death of the King or Queen, a contest is held where competing Vvardenite's showcase their creations and inventions, and the next King or Queen is then elected by vote.

The current ruler is King
