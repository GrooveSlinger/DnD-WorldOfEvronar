# Ardenvale

#### Description

Situated in the middle of the Torian Forest, built into a series of cliffs where rivers split, turn into waterfalls, and converge, The Ardenvale is a stunning city. Priding themselves on magic and their knowledge of it, some places can only be accessed by enchanted Dinghy's that ferry passengers between rivers, and have floating lanterns in the city that light themselves once the sun dusks. The most prominent building in Ardenvale is certainly The Arcanon, a university for magic.
