An organisation of part Monster Hunters, part Guardians, The Wild Wardens take jobs from clients to hunt certain beasts and monsters, usually from alchemists and wizards looking for parts for research or for their use. Sometimes however, the Guild will hear word of a particularly dangerous monster and dispatch a Warden to take care of it before it can harm people.

Though there isn't a formal hierarchy in the Wild Wardens with regards to fighters, Wardens who display exemplary performance may be labelled a "Dragoon" and allowed to wander freely for work and expected to inform the guild of any potential threats. Dragoons usually work alone, but have been known to work in groups when needed, and are given discretion to take on apprentices.

Otherwise, most Wardens are trained in their Headquarters in Kilbren, and after training is complete, are stationed at various cities and villages. Wild Wardens are generally well respected and expected to advise the local guardsmen of threats, defend when necessary, and are forwarded jobs from the guild.

One can expect to find some Wild Wardens stationed in nearly every city in Turogarde, however they lack much presence in Iss-Vordhir outside of any Dragoon's in the area.
