Known by many a citizen in Vornaud, The Coincounter Knights are a vigilante paladin order in Vornaud. Though none have ever been caught to confirm their doctrine, it is believed they are a a paladin order for Virellus, believing that wealth should be equitably distributed, attacking corrupt businesses to steal their coin and giving it to the poor and needy in the city. As such, The Coincounter Knights are particularly popular among the lower-class in Vornaud, despite being labelled as dangerous criminals by the Vornaud Council.
