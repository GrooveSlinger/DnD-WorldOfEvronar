Despite there being a few sibling relationships (but strangely, none parental) in the Pantheon of Evronar, there are only two who share a spot in the Pantheon of "The Virtuous", being [[Deities/The Virtuous/Aurendil\|Aurendil]] and [[Deities/The Virtuous/Kholdir\|Kholdir]].

Curiously, despite there being no depiction of animosity between these two brothers, the same cannot be said of their patron races, The Elves and Dwarves. it is theorised this is because, As elves do not sleep, they cannot access the realm of dreams that Kholdir bestows upon other mortals, and as Dwarves are predisposed to living underground, they do not share in the bounty of The Sun that Aurendil bestows to the world.

Whether this is true is not certain, but what can be for certain is that this animosity between Dwarves and Elves has culminated in a form of competition between the Dwarves' Technology and the Elves' magical prowess. One that peaked in the [[History/War of Turogarde\|War of Turogarde]].
