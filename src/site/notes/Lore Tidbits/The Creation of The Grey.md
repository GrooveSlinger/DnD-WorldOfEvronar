In 2483 AF, A quake could be felt throughout all of Turogarde, a first for the nation. after much confusion and worried masses, an Archmage at Ardenvale by the name of Tanaleth was able to confirm the cause. A giant, primal magic explosion had occurred between Ardenvale and Iss-Vordhir, scarring the land and, seemingly permanently severing The Weave from the area.

As a result, the peoples of The Turovian Alliance became distrustful of Primal Magic, believing it to be too dangerous and prone to causing disaster. as a result, this soured the relationship between the Turovian Alliance and Ayara, who live near a primal magic fount. and Ayara has become far more strict on admittance to their lands.
