The Game starts at 2499 AF (After Fracture), on the continent of Turogarde. Turogarde has recently (Around 65 years ago) entered into a state of relative peace when 3 of the major city states, Vornuad, Vvarden, and Ardenvale, stopped warring and created a peace treaty, including free trade. The following will be brief explanations on the history of the world leading up to the start of the game, and will be hyperlinked to pages with more explanation for convenience.

The War of Fracture is effectively the oldest recorded event in history, though we do know that there was history prior to this point. The War of Fracture began when the gods warred over a difference in opinion over what the purpose of Evronar (the world) and it's peoples was to the gods. it ended when a band of gods, later referred to as The Virtuous, trapped the group of gods (later called The Vile) that wanted to enslave the world behind "The Divine Gate", minimising their influence on the world.

In 2483, about 16 years before the start of the game, a giant magical explosion occurred between Ardenvale and Iss-Vordhir, scarring the land and creating a region of anti-magic called "The Grey". It is believed that this occurred due to a raw, primal spellcaster with a spell gone wrong. as such, there is an air of distrust for Primal Spellcasters currently (Druids, Sorcerers, and Rangers) as it's believed their magic is too dangerous compared to Arcane or Divine magic
