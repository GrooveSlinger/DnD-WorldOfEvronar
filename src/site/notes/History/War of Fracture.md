Not much can be remembered of life before the War of Fracture, as most of civilisation was wiped out when the Gods fought over the fate of the realm. Ethos, Aelith, Raxul, Kaldrax, Grivahk, Taria, and Uros comprise The Vile, those who seeked dominion over mortals and to impose their will. And Bahamut, Aurendil, Dhoine, Elysia, Ibris, Kholdir, Nimara, Virellus, Vurana, and Zerith The Virtuous, those who opposed them and wished for mortals to have their chance for freedom.

Tales of what occurred in the War of Fracture are few and far between. None really know how long it lasted, and depending where in the world you ask different events occured. In Turogarde, however, there are a few events that can be said with relative certainty (or at least mutual agreeance):
* Ethos snuck up behind Bahamut and stabbed him with a cursed dagger, corrupting much of his bloodline and creating a lineage of [[Lore Tidbits/Corrupted Dragons\|Corrupted Dragons]]. The Dagger was then said to have fallen to the earth and created the island of [[Locations/Regions/Turogarde/Dagger's Holm\|Dagger's Holm]]
* Elysia swung her sword at Raxul, the god of Undeath and Decay, and in the process rent the jungles in the centre of Turogarde clean off the earth and creating what we now know as the Elysar plains. Raxul was wounded by this attack, and a single drop of their blood landed on Turogarde, creating the land that is now known as [[Locations/Regions/Turogarde/The Dusklands\|The Dusklands]]
* Nimara, with the help of the other Virtuous, held back The Vile long enough for her to create the Divine Gate, sealing them away and limiting their ability to act upon the land of Evronar permanently

After the War of Fracture ended, The Virtuous and remaining gods, known as The Wild, retreated somewhat from the Mortal World, allowing them to recuperate, culminating in what was then known as The [[History/Age of Reclamation\|Age of Reclamation]]
