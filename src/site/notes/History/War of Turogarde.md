Though up for debate, it seems well founded that the war was precipitated by King Tepelis of Vornaud, greedy as he was for further land and power. Though Ardenvale had a stronger grasp over magic and Vvarden the superior technology, Tepelis was confident that the sheer number of Vornaudians would more than surpass these nations.

He was wrong. the Elysar plains became home to fierce battlegrounds, as all 3 nations fought each other. The Dwarves of Vvarden and the Elves of Ardenvale, already on shaky terms, scarcely needed and excuse to fight each other, and it seemed like this War would really be for all of Turogarde.

The battle was fierce, but the sheer number of Vornaud and the immense firepower of the Ardenvale Battlemages had forced Vvarden into an early retreat. Satisfied that they would be easy to deal with, Tepelis moved all his forces into combatting Ardenvale.

But the Dwarves were not so easily bested. Instead they sought further improvement in their dreams and in their craft, and it wasn't long before an answer came to them: The Warforged were born.

Accounts from Soldiers on The Red Day paint a grim picture. with all their focus on the spellslingers ahead, it was already too late when The Warforged army approached from the south. gleaming red eyes and wielding weapons both mundane and extraordinary, the massacre was immense. Vornaud footsoldiers and Ardenvale Battlemages, caught off guard by this new foe, were decimated in an instant. though not impossible to kill, this sudden advancement from Vvarden pushed both nations back and many believed that Vvarden now became unstoppable. Were it not for [[Lore Tidbits/The Great Awakening\|The Great Awakening]], maybe history would be quite different.

After The Great Awakening, all nations had been exhausted of strength, and Diplomacy became a willing alternative. The leaders of Vvarden and Ardenvale, and a council of distinguished merchants from Vornaud began peace treaty talks, as Tepelis still wanted nothing more than complete domination.

Despite everything, the demands between nations were simple: Vvarden had to outlaw the creation of Warforged, with some exception due to them being accepted as a new progenitor race to the world of Turogarde, such that they be granted 'reproductive rights'. Ardenvale locked away the most heinous spells used during the war, never to be used again. and Vornaud to create and maintain free trade routes between each nation so as to allow each nation to prosper from each other's strength.

All benefited from this deal, but Tepelis still refused to go along with this plan, as nothing less than complete control of the continent was agreeable to him. such was it that the final victim of The War of Turogarde Tepelis himself, executed via beheading.

4 long years this war had been waged, and finally it drifted into [[History/An Uneasy Peace\|An Uneasy Peace]].
