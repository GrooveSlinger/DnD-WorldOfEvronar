As the Gods departed, Mortals were left to pick up the pieces and figure out what to do in the world. Kingdoms rose and fell. small groups departed to make their own tribe in the wild, and nations rose. 2400 Years later, the nation states of Gorthal, Ayara and Kal Badhir were made, and larger than them: the nation states of Vvarden, Vornaud, and Ardenvale.

And as the pieces were picked up, and normalcy returned to the world, and the powerful settled in to build, great things were made. Ardenvale learned great magicks as Aurendil left them with the gift of magic. Vvarden dreamed up great things and became an innovator of technologies large and small, and created marvels that the other nations could scarce believe. And Vornaud, the largest nation in size, created a trade empire with the outside world and the king of Vornaud becoming the most powerful man in the land.

But as the nations of mortals so naturally seek to expand, they also so naturally become fraught with conflict, and so it was, 2430 Years after the The War of Fracture, that The [[History/War of Turogarde\|War of Turogarde]] began.
